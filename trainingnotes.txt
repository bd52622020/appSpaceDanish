What is multiprocessing?

This is simply the ability of a computer to use 2 or more processing units and allocate tasks between them. They share the main-
memory and peripherals so they can process programs simultaneously. 

Does python use multiprocessing?

In Python, single-CPU use is caused by the global interpreter lock (GIL), which allows only one thread to carry the Python 
interpreter at any given time. The GIL was implemented to handle a memory management issue, but as a result, Python is limited 
to using a single processor. This GIL can be unlocked via the multiprocesser module and allows python to distribute tasks among
as many processers as you have or wish to use.
